# Introduction

The format and content of this site is admittedly exploratory, hence should not be a surprise meeting with senseless part or parts. This is how we live, actually.

Data, used in these analyses, is publicly available from official site of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [here](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv).
